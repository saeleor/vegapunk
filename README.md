# Vegapunk, the thoughtful chatbot.

Vegapunk is a multi-layered cognitive architecture designed to function as a versatile autonomous agent.

Vegapunk is composed of "thought layers". Each layer operates as its own agent, governed by its own unique system prompt. There are six distinct layers:

- **Ethos Layer**: Determines the core principles and values guiding the agent's behavior.
- **Strategy Layer**: Focuses on long-term goals and the overarching approach to achieve them.
- **Identity Layer**: Shapes the agent's self-conception, including its role, capabilities, and inherent characteristics.
- **Planning Layer**: Crafts detailed plans, setting milestones and determining the path forward.
- **Control Layer**: Oversees the execution of plans, making real-time adjustments as needed.
- **Execution Layer**: Carries out the tasks, actions, and commands derived from the higher layers.

For now, it's a barely working toy. Hopefully it doesn't remain as such.
